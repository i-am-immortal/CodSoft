          <h3>
            Here are some key points about Bhagat Singh's life and
            contributions:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Early Life: Bhagat Singh was born into a Sikh family that was
              actively involved in the freedom movement. His family had a
              history of patriotic and political involvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jallianwala Bagh Massacre: The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919,
              where British troops killed hundreds of unarmed Indian civilians,
              deeply affected Bhagat Singh and had a lasting impact on his
              commitment to the freedom struggle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Cooperation Movement: Bhagat Singh actively participated in
              the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in the early
              1920s. However, he later became disillusioned with non-violence as
              the primary means of achieving independence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA): Bhagat Singh
              joined the HSRA, a revolutionary organization that believed in
              armed struggle against British rule. He believed that violent
              means were necessary to achieve freedom.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assembly Bombing: Bhagat Singh and his associates became widely
              known when they threw non-lethal smoke bombs in the Central
              Legislative Assembly in Delhi on April 8, 1929, to protest against
              repressive laws. They intended to draw attention to the unjust
              treatment of political prisoners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Execution of Lala Lajpat Rai: Bhagat Singh was involved in a
              protest against the Simon Commission, which led to the death of
              freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai due to police baton charges. In
              retaliation, Bhagat Singh and his associates decided to target the
              police officer responsible, James A. Saunders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Killing of James A. Saunders: On December 17, 1928, Bhagat Singh
              and his associates mistakenly killed J.P. Saunders instead of
              James A. Saunders. They fled the scene but continued to be active
              in their revolutionary activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrest and Trial: Bhagat Singh was arrested in connection with the
              Assembly bombing and later the killing of J.P. Saunders. He
              underwent a long and famous trial in the Central Jail of Lahore.
              During the trial, he and his fellow revolutionaries used the court
              as a platform to express their views on the fight against British
              oppression.
